## Python Flask and OpenAI Whisper-Based Web Application

Welcome to my first-ever web application project! This application is built using Python Flask and leverages the OpenAI Whisper library to provide a unique service: converting spoken data from MP4 video files into text. This project was initially developed locally and serves as a practical tool for extracting and storing verbal content from videos in a textual format, facilitating note-taking and content review.

## Project Overview

The core functionality of this web application revolves around processing MP4 video files to transcribe the audio content. It's an ideal solution for users looking to convert lectures, presentations, or any spoken content in videos into written form, making it easier to study, reference, and analyze the material.

### Key Features:

- **Transcription of MP4 Videos**: Utilizes the power of the OpenAI Whisper library to accurately transcribe spoken words into text.
- **Designed for English Content**: While the application primarily focuses on English content, using the Whisper library's "base" package, it sets the foundation for future enhancements to support additional languages.
- **Local Operation**: Currently, the application operates locally, providing a secure and private environment for users to process their video files.

### Inspiration and Education:

This project was inspired by my coursework at the University of Helsinki, specifically the "Databases and Web Programming" course within the Computer Science curriculum. It represents a practical application of the skills and knowledge acquired through my studies, showcasing my ability to integrate sophisticated AI technology with web development principles to create a functional and user-friendly tool.

## Future Directions

While the application currently excels at processing English content, future updates aim to expand language support and possibly include additional features based on user feedback and technological advancements. The goal is to enhance its versatility and accessibility, making it a more comprehensive tool for students, educators, and professionals alike.

Thank you for exploring my project. I look forward to developing it further and seeing the positive impact it can have on your video content analysis and note-taking processes.
